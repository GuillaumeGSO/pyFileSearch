# pyFileSearch
Simple GUI tool to search from filename using a file index generated by pyFileIndexer

My comments in french for a fresh start
- [x] TODO : everything in english
- [ ] TODO : code separation between main, interface, index file handling...

## Search mode
* -i ou --index <indexfilename> : set the index file name to use <indexfilename>, default "index.pbz2"
       Note : the index file has to be generated by pyFileIndexer (no extension required is the argument)
